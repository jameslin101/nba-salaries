                In this Interactive Slideshow, we will explore the salaries and performance of NBA teams and players in the 2022-2023 season.
                <br><br>
                The first slide ranks the salaries of the NBA teams, with a horizontal line indicating the salary cap.
                <br><br>
                The NBA uses a soft salary cap - the more a team goes over, the stiffer the financial penalties. Typically, teams will try not to go over unless they are aiming to win a championship.
                <br><br>
                You can click on a bar to get a pioe chart breakdown of each player's salary as a percentage of the team's total.
                <br><br>
                You can also hover over a bar to see details on the team's actual performance, but we will explore that more in the next slide.

            <p>
                Below is a plot showing the correlation between Team Salary and Win Percentage. 
                <br><br>
                Although teams that spend more money on their players generally perform better, it is not guaranteed. You can see both the top spending teams - the Golden State Warriors and L.A. Clippers both underperform expectations.
                <br><br>
                The Memphis Grizzlies outperformed expectations the most, while the Detroit Pistons underperformed the most.
                <br><br>
                Click on the team logos to see the team's detailed player name, position, salary, and stats breakdown.
                <br><br>
                Next, we will visualize players based on their advanced analytics stats.

            <p>
                Below is a plot showing the correlation between player salary and performance according to various advanced metrics stats.
                <br><br>
                Please click on a team below the plot to show the scatter plot of their players' advanced metrics. (Try starting with the 2022-23 champions, the Denver Nuggets.)
                <br><br>
                You can visually compare the talent on each team. Each team's dots are colored based on the team's primary color. You can scan the players that are high up on top - they are typically the star players.
                <br><br>
                You can hover over a dot to see more details on a player. Near the top of the plots, you can often find Nicola Jokic, a 3x MVP, who is a high outlier by all metrics. However, Joel Embiid, who also compiled impressive stats, was the MVP for the 2022-23 season. 
                <br><br>
                You can also click on multiple teams and see how their players stack up against each other. Each dot is color coded by team.
                <br><br>
                Below is a set of radio buttons that allows you to switch between different advanced metrics. Hover over a button for a description of the metric.
